# Dice-App
This is a simple mobile application built using React Native. The app features a dice that can be rolled by the user. The dice is customizable, allowing it to display a number range (e.g., 1-6, 1-4, or 1-3) based on the user's preference. The user taps on the dice, and it generates a random number within the specified range.
